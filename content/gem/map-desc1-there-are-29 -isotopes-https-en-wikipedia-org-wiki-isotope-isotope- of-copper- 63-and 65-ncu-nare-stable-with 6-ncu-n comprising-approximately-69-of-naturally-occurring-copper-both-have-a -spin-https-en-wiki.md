desc1: There are 29 [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope) of copper.
  63 and 65 Cu are stable, with 6 Cu comprising approximately 69% of naturally
  occurring copper; both have a
  [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of. The other isotopes
  are [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity), with the most
  stable being 67 Cu with a [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life)
  of 61.83 hours. Seven [metastable
  isomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_isomer) have been
  characterized; 68m Cu is the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes.
  Isotopes with a [mass number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number) above
  64 decay by [β−](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay), whereas those with
  a mass number below 64 decay by
  [β+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission). [64
  Cu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper-64), which has a half-life of 12.7
  hours, decays both ways.

  Copper is produced in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust in a
  proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). In nature, copper occurs in a
  variety of minerals, including native copper, copper sulfides such as
  chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite, covellite, and chalcocite, copper sulfosalts
  such as tetrahedite-tennantite, and enargite, copper carbonates such as
  azurite and malachite, and as copper(I) or copper(II) oxides such as cuprite
  and tenorite, respectively. Copper is the 25th most abundant element in
  Earth's crust, representing 50 ppm compared with 75 ppm for zinc, and 14 ppm
  for lead.
